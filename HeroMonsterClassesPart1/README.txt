# Hero Monster Advanced

## Requirements
This was a two-part challenge, creating a text game that will play out a battle between a hero character and a monster character. The complexity arose with the second half of the challenge when we added a Dice class that rolls a random number based on the maximum damage of the character rolling.

## Results
I struggled a little with the first half of the challenge until was able to get my head around the process of creating properties and methods within a class and then accessing those from a specific instance of that class later on. The second half of the challenge just took some troubleshooting, but after a few passes stepping through the code in Visual Studio I was able to properly hook up the Dice object so that it was taking in random numbers using the correct number of sides for the character. I was able to complete both halves of the challenge and get the application working as required!

*Notes:*
* *I built the second version of the application from where I left off after the first half, that is why there is only one project file in this repository.*
* *I have included the text files for the challenge requirements if you are curious.*
